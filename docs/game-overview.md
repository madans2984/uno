## Game Overview

### Rules

The game has 112 cards (see the breakdown [here](cards.md)). Each player is dealt seven cards with the gameplay goal being the first to get rid of all of your cards. Each player attempts to match the card in the Discard Pile by the symbol, color, or using a Wild card to change the color of the pile. An example would be if the Discard Pile has a "Red 0" then players can play either a red card or a 0. If the player was to put down a Wild car they can choose the current color in play. 

There are a few special cards which have actions associated with them. 
    - The Wild card allows the player to change the color in play. 
    - The Skip card skips the next player's turn.
    - The Plus 2 card has the next player draw 2 cards and skips their turn.
    - The Wild Plus 4 card has the next player draw 4 cards and skips their turn. It also allows the current player to change the color in play.
    - The Reverse card reverse the order of game play. 

The main modification we made was that special cards cannot be stacked and have a cumulative effect.
